    <p >Aqua ensure proposes to supply a water filtration plant with softening unit for this project. The objective of the treatment process is to produce processes water efficiently and economically from source water tube wells. The filtration system to be provided will produce a product water quality of less than 50 mg/L hardness when operating on a feed water, at a water temperature of 25 c with its design optimum efficiency to give maximum product at best result. The filtration plant with softening unit will be of robust construction and designed to conservative standards for versatility in the event of feed water quality and temperature variations. The system design will include provisions for easy maintenance easy approach towards equipment and auto backwash to minimize fouling and piping corrosion. The filtration plant with softening unit provided will include sand and multi cartridge filter include 02 number of 5 micron filter to remove any undesirable impurities material of construction for the fabrication of sand filter and is FRP, and softener material of construction is FRP for polishing of soft water fine filtration system are installed. The filtration plant with softening unit will be proved by parts and in 1st stage the components of system are delivered to site of installation. The unit will be assembled, prewired system, in order to accommodate easily at the site of installation. The filtration plant with softening unit supplied will include automatic valves and switches and shall be capable of automatic operation with minimal human involvement.</p>

                <p >Aqua ensure proposes to supply a water filtration plant with softening unit for this project. The objective of the treatment process is to produce processes water efficiently and economically from source water tube wells. The filtration system to be provided will produce a product water quality of less than 50 mg/L hardness when operating on a feed water, at a water temperature of 25 c with its design optimum efficiency to give maximum product at best result. The filtration plant with softening unit will be of robust construction and designed to conservative standards for versatility in the event of feed water quality and temperature variations. The system design will include provisions for easy maintenance easy approach towards equipment and auto backwash to minimize fouling and piping corrosion. The filtration plant with softening unit provided will include sand and multi cartridge filter include 02 number of 5 micron filter to remove any undesirable impurities material of construction for the fabrication of sand filter and is FRP, and softener material of construction is FRP for polishing of soft water fine filtration system are installed. The filtration plant with softening unit will be proved by parts and in 1st stage the components of system are delivered to site of installation. The unit will be assembled, prewired system, in order to accommodate easily at the site of installation. The filtration plant with softening unit supplied will include automatic valves and switches and shall be capable of automatic operation with minimal human involvement.</p>
